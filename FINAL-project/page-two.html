        <h2>From Sketches to the Screen</h2>
        <p>When attempting to make a series or movie, the visual aspects of your project often involve concept art, storyboards or sketches. That is especially the case with cartoons. As such, it requires a bit of experience in drawing. It usually takes some time to finish your art, but it varies depending on the style and quality of what you're trying to convey. The tools also vary, from pencils to clay to even software.</p>
        <p>If you're looking to do concept art, make sure you know what kind of tools you'll need for the job. There is an abundant amount of stuff required to make a good sketch, but It's recommended to teach yourself how to draw before getting in on the action.</p>

            <li>Sketches often require pieces of paper, and some kind of drawing material like a pencil or pen.</li>
            <li>Storyboards may also be applied to ensure the story goes where it needs to.</li>
            <li>Once the needed sketches are finished, they are adapted into something more professional, like a 3D render or colored 2D model.</li>
            <li>At the end, given the effort and quality put into it, the final product may turn out to be something beautiful in a sense.</li>
